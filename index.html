								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Cade Fisher, a dedicated computer science student with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. With a solid foundation in customer service and coursework in Java, SQL, and C++, I am eagerly preparing to launch my career in the tech industry. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at Western Governor University, I am committed to continuous learning and growth in order to make meaningful contributions in an entry-level position upon graduation in August 2024.</p>
								<p>Throughout my academic journey, I've engaged in various projects that have honed my skills and allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings. From developing an inventory management system using Java to designing and implementing a scheduling application utilizing Java, SQL, and a virtual machine, I've gained hands-on experience in software development and database management. Additionally, my professional experience as a Reservation Manager at U-Haul of Utah has equipped me with valuable technical and operational skills, further enhancing my readiness to embark on a fulfilling career in technology.</p>

								<strong>Inventory Management</strong><br>
								<p>In my inventory management project, I employed Java and utilized object-oriented programming principles to create a robust and efficient system. I focused on implementing key functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting items to ensure seamless inventory management. Additionally, I incorporated advanced features including searching, sorting, and generating detailed inventory reports, providing users with comprehensive control and insight into their inventory. Through meticulous design and coding, I aimed to optimize efficiency and usability, ultimately delivering a reliable solution that streamlines inventory management processes for enhanced productivity and effectiveness.</p>

								<strong>Scheduling Management</strong><br>
								<p>In my scheduling management project, I leveraged a combination of Java, SQL, and a virtual machine to develop a comprehensive scheduling application. This multifaceted solution was designed to facilitate the creation, management, and tracking of appointments with ease and efficiency. By integrating seamlessly with a SQL database, I ensured secure and efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling users to access and manage their schedules seamlessly. Additionally, employing a virtual machine enhanced platform independence and optimized performance, ensuring that the application operates smoothly across different operating systems while delivering optimal performance. Through meticulous design and implementation, I aimed to provide users with a powerful tool for effective scheduling management, catering to their diverse needs and enhancing overall productivity.</p>

								<strong>Delivery Algorithm</strong><br>
								<p>In my Delivery Algorithm project, I gained valuable experience in developing a robust delivery management system using Python. The project involved creating a custom hash table to handle package data and implementing an efficient delivery algorithm to ensure timely and accurate deliveries. Working with Python allowed me to leverage its capabilities for data manipulation and algorithm design, while exporting and reading CSV files enabled me to integrate real-world data into my program seamlessly. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of how to manage and optimize logistical operations effectively.</p>

								<strong>Rental Data Analysis</strong><br>
								<p>In my Rental Data Analysis project, I had the opportunity to dive deep into data transformation and reporting using PostgreSQL. The project involved creating a comprehensive business report by designing detailed and summary tables, which required a thorough understanding of SQL functions, triggers, and stored procedures. I used PostgreSQL to write custom SQL functions for data transformation, ensuring that the detailed and summary tables presented actionable insights. Developing triggers to keep the summary table up-to-date and implementing stored procedures for data refreshes were particularly challenging and rewarding. This experience honed my skills in SQL and data management, and provided me with practical knowledge of how to transform and analyze data to support business decisions effectively.</p>

								<strong>Career ChatBot</strong><br>
								<p>In my Career ChatBot project, I created an interactive chatbot using AIML in the Pandorabot environment to assist graduating students with career guidance. This project provided hands-on experience in developing a conversational agent capable of recommending computing jobs based on students' strengths and preferences. Building the chatbot involved designing its functionality to simulate a career advisor's interaction, helping students explore potential career paths by analyzing their inputs. Crafting the AIML code allowed me to enhance the chatbot’s ability to provide relevant advice and engage users effectively. This experience sharpened my skills in AI development and offered insight into optimizing conversational agents for real-world applications, ultimately demonstrating how technology can support career counseling in an educational setting.</p>
