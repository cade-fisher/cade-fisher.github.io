								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Cade Fisher, a dedicated computer science student with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. With a solid foundation in customer service and coursework in Java, SQL, and C++, I am eagerly preparing to launch my career in the tech industry. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at Western Governor University, I am committed to continuous learning and growth in order to make meaningful contributions in an entry-level position upon graduation in August 2024.</p>
								<p>Throughout my academic journey, I've engaged in various projects that have honed my skills and allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings. From developing an inventory management system using Java to designing and implementing a scheduling application utilizing Java, SQL, and a virtual machine, I've gained hands-on experience in software development and database management. Additionally, my professional experience as a Reservation Manager at U-Haul of Utah has equipped me with valuable technical and operational skills, further enhancing my readiness to embark on a fulfilling career in technology.</p>

								<strong>Inventory Management</strong><br>
								<p>In my inventory management project, I employed Java and utilized object-oriented programming principles to create a robust and efficient system. I focused on implementing key functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting items to ensure seamless inventory management. Additionally, I incorporated advanced features including searching, sorting, and generating detailed inventory reports, providing users with comprehensive control and insight into their inventory. Through meticulous design and coding, I aimed to optimize efficiency and usability, ultimately delivering a reliable solution that streamlines inventory management processes for enhanced productivity and effectiveness.</p>
								
								<strong>Schduling Management</strong><br>
								<p>In my scheduling management project, I leveraged a combination of Java, SQL, and a virtual machine to develop a comprehensive scheduling application. This multifaceted solution was designed to facilitate the creation, management, and tracking of appointments with ease and efficiency. By integrating seamlessly with a SQL database, I ensured secure and efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling users to access and manage their schedules seamlessly. Additionally, employing a virtual machine enhanced platform independence and optimized performance, ensuring that the application operates smoothly across different operating systems while delivering optimal performance. Through meticulous design and implementation, I aimed to provide users with a powerful tool for effective scheduling management, catering to their diverse needs and enhancing overall productivity.</p>
